<h1 class="heading1"> data scientista society</h1>
    <p class="bodystyle">The vision of the Data Scientista Socity is a world full of data of the women, by the women, and for the women.</p>
    <p class="bodystyle">The group uses Meetup and LinkedIn.</p>
<h1 class="heading1">daughters of dorothea dix</h1>
<p class="bodystyle">The women who live here 
    Need empowerment to follow the example of empathy, advocacy, and leadership of Dorothea Dix.
    Not only because this legacy deserves to be celebrated 
    But also because today’s woman needs to pursue connection, growth, and the fulfillment of making a difference.
    Presently, we observe women in isolation, divided, barely capable of supporting one another, and prone to wait: to speak, to be invited, and to be perfect. 
    But we believe we can draw on the tradition of women’s societies to create a modern organization that will respond.
    The practices of this organization must create an environment of inclusion. 
    It must insist on the physicality of connection, with technology as a servant. 
    The capability to provide referrals, not specific advice, is essential. 
    But as a group we can discover, define, and explore the beliefs and behaviors that help a woman to maintain and grow her own mindscape. </p>
